mw - VCS-like nonsense for MediaWiki websites

== Basic workflow ==
We don't have a nice installation process yet, so set the following alias:
  alias mw="PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:PATH_TO/mw/src PATH_TO/mw/bin/mw"
where PATH_TO is the path to your local mw repository.

mw init http://example.com/w/api.php
mw login  # if you need/want to
mw pull 'Main Page'
$EDITOR Main_Page.wiki
mw fetch  # check for newer revisions; this command doesn't exist yet
mw update  # apply newer revisions; this command doesn't exist yet
mw commit
