== Basic workflow ==
See HACKING on how to run this; a nice setup.py isn't done yet.

mw init http://example.com/w/api.php # use -u username if you like,
                                     # you'll be asked for a password later
mw pull 'Main Page'
$EDITOR Main_Page.wiki
mw fetch # check for newer revisions
mw update # apply newer revisions
mw commit
