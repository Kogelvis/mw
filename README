mw - VCS-like nonsense for MediaWiki websites

== Basic workflow ==
We don't have a nice installation process yet, so set the following alias:
  alias mw="PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:PATH_TO/mw/src PATH_TO/mw/bin/mw"
where PATH_TO is the path to your local mw repository.

mw init http://example.com/w/api.php
mw login  # if you need/want to
mw pull 'Main Page'
$EDITOR Main_Page.wiki
mw commit
mw status

== Status command ==

Will show whether a file has been locally modified ('M') or is clean ('C').

== Pull command ==

The pull command has the following features:

* Can pull a new page/file, or update one.
* Can be provided a page name or file name.
* If the wiki has updates, it will pull those unless they conflict 
  with local changes. The user must then resolve/merge conflicts.
