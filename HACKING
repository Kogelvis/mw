The preferred method of submitting patches is by forking the repository,
committing changes, and then making the repository accessible. This is most
easily done on GitHub, but you can put it anywhere I can get it.

Changing how something already works in the .mw metadir requires a damn
good reason since we don't want to introduce incompatibilities at all in
the tree.

Code submitted should follow PEP 8. If it doesn't, I'll modify your changes (in
later commits) until they are in line that style.
